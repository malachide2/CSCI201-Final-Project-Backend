Many prompts to integrate Git into Eclipse and setup the Dynamic Web App architecture

Eclipse has a lot of hidden files or folders that only exist internally once the project is marked Dynamic Web App so figuring out that was different than the standard Assignment setup. However, doing these steps wasn't hard, it was just initially confusing which steps to take.

Prompt:
Implement the necessary backend Java servlets for adding new hikes to the database. Here's the requirements for this feature, a breakdown of the full system, and example code of this system's architecture.
Issues:

Issues:
Seems to work as expected afterwards so I just needed a way to test it.

Prompt:
Make a dummy file where I can test the functionality of the endpoints
